I write lyrics and novels, both in Mandarin Chinese. I can speak and understand Mandarin Chinese and English. I can understand Taiwanese Hokkien and Japanese but cannot speak them fluently. I am also a fan of Vocaloid music (vocals created using singing voice synthesis systems such as the Vocaloid software; nowaday it is a more general term related to all singing voice synthesis music).
